My master's thesis which adapted a signal processing method, the Autoperiod Method by Vlachos et al., 2005, to measure the periodicity of patterned features of stress and strain. Images of stress and strain were generated from finite element models of polycrystals that were elastically heterogeneous. The adaption of the Autoperiod method's capabilities were tested with toy images of stripes and later applied to stress and strain images of models with varying degree of elastic heterogeneity.
