As space exploration expandes it's goals to other celestial bodies in our solar system, such as Mars, a need for more sustainable practices grow. In situ resource utilization addresses sustainablility by generating spent resources on the celestial bodies. For example, rocket propellant (oxidizer + fuel) would take up 85 - 95% of the weight of a rocket to Mars, and 80% of propellant by mass to return to Earth. If the fuel (hydrogen gas) can be generated in situ and replenished on Mars, the deliverable mission payload capacity could be increased. This conference paper introduces a set of water-rock experiments where simulated Martian soils are dissolved in water to examine how much hydrogen gas is produced. If hydrogen gas could be generated by water oxidizing ferrious iron-rich minerals, oxidation of minerals on Mars or the Moon may be viable for supplementing propellant resources.
