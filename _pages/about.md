ðŸ“š My research interest is exploring the behavior of anisotropic materials through simulations and numerical methods.

ðŸ§  I am currently learning more about elastic waves, machine learning, deep learning, and programming. 

# Selected Experience

## ðŸ’» Master's Program
I graduated with a M.S. in Geoscience with Dr. Pamela Burnley as my advisor. I gained great insights into geophysics, and developed my interests of solid mechanics and programming.
<!-- data analysis through Python, Matlab, Mathematica, and R.-->

My thesis included simulating stress in elastically heterogeneous, and porous polycrystals using finite element analysis. We measured the spatial periodicity of stress and strain patterning in our polycyrstals models.

<!-- I implemented the AutoPeriod method (Vlachos et al., 2005) in Python, and was able to detect reoccuring horizontal periodicities of the stress and strain features. -->  

## ðŸ§ª Undergraduate Program
I graduated with a B.S. in Geology from the Univeristy of Nevada, Las Vegas in May 2020.
During my undergrad, I worked in Dr. Elisabeth Hausrath's laboratory and gained a wide array of geochemical and geomicrobial experience. 

For my undergraduate research project, Water-Interactions on Mars: Production of H2
and other valuable resources, I worked under the guidance of Dr. Christopher Adcock. We conducted dissolution experiments of simulated Martian soils in a carbon dioxide rich atmosphere, and measured hydrogen gas production.

<!-- I assisted with several experiments including: mineral synthesis, dissolution experiments in the field, and laboratory, and algae and bacterial culturing. I also assisted using instruments including: gas chromatograph, atomic absorption spectrophotometer, scanning electron microscope, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. -->
