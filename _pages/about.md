ðŸ“š My research interest is exploring the behavior of anisotropic materials through simulations and numerical methods.

ðŸ§  I am currently learning more about elastic waves, machine learning, deep learning, and programming. 

# Selected Experience

## ðŸ’» Master's Program
I graduated with a M.S. in Geoscience with Dr. Pamela Burnley as my advisor. I gained great insights into geophysics during the program, and developed my interests into solid mechanics and implementing data analysis through Python, Matlab, Mathematica, and R.

My thesis included simulating stress in elastically heterogeneous, and porous polycrystals using finite element analysis. We then measured the spatial periodicity of stress and strain patterning in our polycyrstals models. I implemented the AutoPeriod method (Vlachos et al., 2005) in Python, and was able to detect reoccuring horizontal periodicities of the stress and strain features.  

## ðŸ§ª Undergraduate Program
I graduated with a B.S. in Geology from the Univeristy of Nevada, Las Vegas in May 2020.
During my undergrad, I worked in Dr. Elisabeth Hausrath's laboratory and gained a wide array of geochemical and geomicrobial experience. 

For my undergraduate research project, Water-Interactions on Mars: Production of H2
and other valuable resources, I worked under the guidance of Dr. Christopher Adcock. We conducted dissolution experiments of Mars simulated soils in a carbon dioxide rich atmosphere, and measured hydrogen gas production. 

<!-- I assisted with several experiments including: mineral synthesis, dissolution experiments in the field, and laboratory, and algae and bacterial culturing. I also assisted using instruments including: gas chromatograph, atomic absorption spectrophotometer, scanning electron microscope, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. -->
