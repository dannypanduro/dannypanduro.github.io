ðŸ“š My research interest is exploring the behavior of anisotropic materials through simulations and numerical methods.

ðŸ§  I am currently learning more about elastic waves, machine learning, deep learning, and programming.

The 

## ðŸ§ª Undergraduate Program
I graduated with a B.S. of Geology from the Univeristy of Nevada, Las Vegas.
During my undergrad, I worked in Dr. Elisabeth Hausrath's laboratory and gained a wide array of geochemical and geomicrobial experience. 

For my undergraduate research project, Water-Interactions on Mars: Production of H2
and other valuable resources, I worked under the guidance of Dr. Christopher Adcock. We conducted dissolution experiments of Mars simulated soils in a carbon dioxide rich atmosphere, and measured hydrogen gas production. 

<>(I assisted with several experiments including: mineral synthesis, dissolution experiments, and algae and bacterial culturing. I also assisted using instruments including: gas chromatograph, atomic absorption spectrophotometer, scanning electron microscope, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer.)
